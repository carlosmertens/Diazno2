        DIAZNO, the Berlin based singer-songwriter and producer, is carving a
        niche for himself with an audacious sound blending everything from pop
        to folk, soul, rock and reggae. Born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, the
        multi-instrumentalist grew up playing in church and studying classical
        music but since moving to Berlin in 2016 has redefined his music.

        On stage, he packs the effervescence and drive expected of a musician
        not very keen on boundaries or holding back making every song an intense
        experience. Although notorious for larger-than-life-sounding
        productions, full of movement and colours, he is not afraid to strip it
        all away and deliver his songs just as he wrote them - with his soulful
        voice and guitar.

        An avid storyteller, DIAZNO’s lyrics take the listener on a
        rollercoaster of emotions, encompassing themes of love, heartbreak,
        tragedy and joy - in his words, “…these are our stories, and they must
        be told…”.

        As a guitarist, DIAZNO has collaborated with artists like Amaarae, Nick
        Talos, Anoki, Feven Yoseph among others. He has spent the bulk of 2020
        and 2021 recording new music for his debut solo project in Lagos and
        Berlin. DIAZNO is set to return to the stage in 2022 with his new
        backing band and newly recorded material.
